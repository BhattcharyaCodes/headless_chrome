# working with headless_chrome
Puppeteer is a Node library developed by the Chrome team. It provides a high-level API to control Headless Chrome. It’s similar to other automated testing libraries like Phantom and NightmareJS above, but it only works with the latest versions of Chrome (Chrome 59+).  The Puppeteer API can be used to take screenshots, create PDFs, navigate pages, and fetch information from pages. I’ll write some example code to see Puppeteer in action.  
1) Taking a screenshot
2)




Pre-requisite:
Install Puppeteer with the npm package: npm i puppeteer
Also, create a JavaScript file in which we’ll write code to demonstrate Puppeteer, you can name it puppeteer.js. Edit the newly created file with the code.
